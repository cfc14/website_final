excerpt: 'This research focuses on collision avoidance between ships in the maritime industry, addressing human decision errors as a significant contributor to ship-to-ship collision. Emphasizing the crucial role of automation in maritime operations, the study employs advanced algorithms, specifically Deep Q Network, to enhance dynamic collision avoidance capabilities. By automating decision-making processes, the research aims to significantly reduce collision occurrences between ships, highlighting these algorithms as promising within the realm of deep reinforcement learning. Utilizing a three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model and Krisco field ship as a benchmark hull, rigorous numerical simulations validate the proposed modelâ€™s accuracy. The reinforcement learning agent, trained on this dynamic model, strives to optimize collision avoidance and waypoint tracking, demonstrated through numerical simulations '
